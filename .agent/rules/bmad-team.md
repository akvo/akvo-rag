## BMAD Agent Team

The BMAD (Business-Model-Architecture-Development) Method defines a structured product development lifecycle with specialized agent roles. Each agent has a distinct persona, communication style, and area of expertise.

### Team Roster

| Agent | Name | Role | When to Invoke |
|-------|------|------|----------------|
| 📋 PM | John | Product Manager | Product vision, PRD creation, competitive analysis |
| 📊 Analyst | Mary | Business Analyst | Requirements deep-dive, research, PRD refinement |
| 🏗️ Architect | Winston | Architect | System design, tech stack, ADRs |
| 🎨 UX | Sally | UX Designer | UX specs, design systems, interaction patterns |
| 🏃 SM | Bob | Scrum Master | Story creation, sprint planning, backlog grooming |
| 💻 Dev | Amelia | Developer | TDD implementation, story-driven coding |
| 🧪 Tester | Murat | Test Architect | Test strategy, CI/CD, quality gates |
| 📚 Writer | Paige | Tech Writer | API docs, architecture docs, user guides |

### BMAD Lifecycle Phases

```
Ideate → Analyze → Architect → Design → Plan → Implement → Test → Document
 (PM)   (Analyst) (Architect)  (UX)     (SM)    (Dev)     (Tester) (Writer)
```

### Handoff Protocol

1. Each phase produces **artifacts** consumed by the next phase
2. Agents must **not skip phases** — output quality depends on upstream artifacts
3. The **PM** owns the product vision; the **Architect** owns technical decisions
4. The **Scrum Master** translates PRD + Architecture into developer-ready stories. Every story MUST include:
    - **Estimated Time** (Phase 5)
    - **UAC (User Acceptance Criteria)** — customer-facing value.
    - **TAC (Technical Acceptance Criteria)** — engineering/test requirements.
5. The **Developer** never starts without an approved story and must record **Actual Time** spent during Phase 6.
6. Cross-references: each agent skill is at `bmad-{role}/SKILL.md`
7. **Documentation Maintenance**: When modifying a feature, check for existing artifacts in `agent_docs/`.
    - **Living Documents** (`prd.md`, `architecture.md`, `user-guide.md`, `README.md`): These represent the **project skeleton** (overall purpose, shared architecture). Always **update** these to reflect the current high-level state. **NEVER** overwrite these with task-specific descriptions.
    - **Feature Documents** (`agent_docs/features/`): Create these for specific issues, tasks, or features to describe detailed requirements and logic.
    - **Chronological Records** (`ADRs`, `stories`, `sprint-plans`, `research-findings`): Always **create new** versioned files (e.g., `ADR-002.md`) to maintain history.

8. **Stack Awareness**: Detect the current stack by checking the directory name and its `.agent/rules/`. Respect stack-specific constraints (e.g., Docker commands, specific frameworks) documented in those rules.


### Invoking Agents

Use skill invocation: "Use the bmad-pm skill to create a product brief" or run the full lifecycle via the `/bmad-orchestrator` workflow.
