# RAG Evaluation System: First Attempt Reflection

## What We Accomplished

1. **Created a RAG evaluation system with:**
   - A utility to interact with the Akvo RAG chat API (`chat_util.py`)
   - A Streamlit dashboard for evaluation (`app.py`) 
   - Integration with RAGAS for evaluation metrics
   - Logging instrumentation for tracking the RAG process
   - Docker configuration for exposing Streamlit

2. **Built supporting files:**
   - README with setup and usage instructions
   - Requirements file for dependencies
   - Docker override configuration
   - Command-line script for launching the dashboard

3. **Successfully resolved deployment issues:**
   - Fixed Docker port conflict issues
   - Created proper documentation for different deployment scenarios

## Challenges & Pitfalls

1. **Docker Configuration Complexity**
   - We encountered port conflicts between `nginx` and `nginx-dev` services
   - Docker networks weren't being properly removed, causing "network has active endpoints" errors
   - Understanding the interaction between multiple Docker Compose files was challenging

2. **Dependency Management**
   - The RAGAS library had changed since initial implementation, causing import errors
   - Dependencies weren't automatically installed when restarting containers
   - No dev/prod separation for dependencies

3. **Documentation Overload**
   - Initial README became bloated with troubleshooting steps
   - Too many configuration options made instructions confusing
   - Lost focus on the primary user journey

4. **External Service Requirements**
   - System requires OpenAI API key for evaluation metrics
   - Assumes specific knowledge base exists in the system

## What I Would Do Differently

1. **Docker Setup**
   - **Start simple**: Use a single Docker Compose file for the evaluation system instead of overrides
   - **Namespace properly**: Create a separate network for the evaluation system
   - **Test thoroughly**: Verify port conflicts and dependencies earlier in development
   - **Use environment variables**: For ports to make configuration more flexible

2. **Dependency Management**
   - **Pin exact versions**: Use specific versions in requirements.txt
   - **Create a virtual environment**: Use a separate venv for the evaluation system
   - **Build a dedicated container**: Create a separate container specifically for evaluation
   - **Test dependencies**: Verify all imports work before implementing features

3. **Documentation**
   - **Focus on the happy path**: Simplify instructions for the main use case
   - **Separate troubleshooting**: Keep troubleshooting in a separate document
   - **Use screenshots**: Add visual guides for the UI setup
   - **Provide examples**: Include sample evaluation outputs

4. **Code Structure**
   - **Use proper versioning**: Import specific versions of dependencies
   - **Add error handling**: Better error messages for missing dependencies
   - **Modularize**: Split code into more manageable components
   - **Add tests**: Create tests for the evaluation system

5. **User Experience**
   - **Reduce prerequisites**: Minimize external dependencies
   - **Simplify configuration**: Use sensible defaults where possible
   - **Add progress feedback**: Better visibility into long-running processes
   - **Improve error messages**: Make errors more actionable

## Next Steps

For our next attempt, I would:

1. Create a standalone Docker container for the evaluation system
2. Use a fixed version of RAGAS that's known to work
3. Reduce the complexity of the setup process
4. Focus on making the evaluation results more actionable
5. Add better visualization of the RAG process for debugging

The import error with `context_relevancy` suggests we need to check RAGAS documentation for the correct imports or downgrade to a compatible version, as the API appears to have changed.

## Key Lessons

1. **Simplicity over flexibility**: Optimize for the common case rather than handling every edge case
2. **Test in isolation**: Verify components work independently before integration
3. **Know your dependencies**: Understand the APIs of libraries you're using
4. **Clear documentation**: Focus on clear, concise instructions for the primary use case
5. **Infrastructure as code**: Treat Docker configuration as seriously as application code
