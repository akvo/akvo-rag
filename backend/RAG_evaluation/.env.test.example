# ðŸ§ª Configuration for RAG Evaluation End-to-End (E2E) Tests
# This file defines environment variables used during automated testing.

# === RAG API Configuration ===
# Set the base URL for the RAG API.
# If 'localhost' does not work (e.g., in Dockerized environments on macOS),
# you can try using: http://backend:8000
# Why does this work? â†’ When tests are run inside a container, service names (like `backend`)
# resolve to other containers in the same Docker network.
RAG_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
RAG_USERNAME=admin@example.com
RAG_PASSWORD=password
RAG_KNOWLEDGE_BASE=Living Income Benchmark Knowledge Base

# === Evaluation Settings ===
# Specify the OpenAI model used for evaluation (e.g., gpt-4o, gpt-4-turbo)
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o

# === Test Data (CSV Option) ===
# You can use a CSV file to provide test prompts and expected responses.
# Uncomment and adjust the paths below if you want to use a custom CSV:
# CSV_FILE_HOST=/absolute/path/on/host/test_queries.csv          # Used if test runs from host
# CSV_FILE_CONTAINER=/app/RAG_evaluation/test_data.csv           # Used if test runs inside a container

# === Test Data (Inline Queries) ===
# If no CSV file is provided, these individual prompt-reference pairs will be used.
TEST_QUERY_1=What is the living income benchmark?
TEST_REFERENCE_1=The living income benchmark is a measure of the income needed for a household to afford a decent standard of living.

TEST_QUERY_2=How is the living income benchmark calculated?
TEST_REFERENCE_2=The living income benchmark is calculated based on the cost of a basic but decent standard of living in a specific place.

# === Runtime Configuration ===
# Timeout in seconds for the evaluation process
EVALUATION_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=420

# Optional: Slow down browser automation for visual debugging (in milliseconds)
BROWSER_SLOW_MO=1000
