Investment Climate & Government Support: What is the current investment climate in Kenya and what specific measures or incentives has the government put in place to attract and facilitate private sector investment?,"Kenya presents itself as a dynamic and resilient investment destination, positioning itself as East and Central Africa's largest and most advanced economy. The country has consistently outperformed its regional peers in GDP growth and is considered a low-risk investment environment with positive investor sentiment and a strong global brand presence. The private sector is substantial and actively contributes to economic growth, accounting for approximately 80% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP).

Despite this positive outlook, Kenya's economy remains highly dependent on climate-sensitive sectors like agriculture, water, energy, tourism, wildlife, and health, making it vulnerable to climate change impacts such as droughts and floods. These impacts lead to significant economic costs, estimated at 3-5% of GDP annually, and are projected to rise without appropriate climate action. Wealth distribution is also unequal, with higher poverty rates in rural areas and ASAL (Arid and Semi-Arid Lands) regions, which make up 89% of the country and are particularly targeted for development. Challenges in the investment climate also include a lack of appropriate financing for agriculture (one of the least funded sectors), high non-performing loans, and sometimes unpredictable investment policies.

The Kenyan government has implemented various measures and incentives to attract and facilitate private sector investment:

Policy and Legal Frameworks

Kenya Vision 2030: This national blueprint aims to transform Kenya into a newly industrialising middle-income country by 2030, with a sustained economic growth rate of 10%. It integrates economic, social, and political pillars and is operationalised through five-year Medium Term Plans (MTPs), which include climate-smart agriculture interventions.

Climate Change Act (2016, amended 2023): This pioneering legislation in Africa mandates the development of national climate change action plans (NCCAPs) every five years and requires public entities at national and county levels to integrate climate considerations into their planning, budgeting, decision-making, and implementation. It also provides incentives and obligations for private sector contributions to low-carbon, climate-resilient development.

National Adaptation Plan (NAP) and Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC): These documents set out Kenya's commitments and priorities for adapting to climate change and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, aligning with international agreements like the Paris Agreement.

ASAL Policy (Sessional Paper No. 8 of 2012): This policy aims to facilitate sustainable development in ASALs by increasing investments and ensuring resource use aligns with the reality of local lives, strengthening resilience to drought.

Sector-Specific Policies: Policies like the National Irrigation Policy 2017, National Water Policy, National Agricultural Extension Policy (NASEP), and the Agricultural Sector Transformation and Growth Strategy (ASTGS) provide guidance and incentives for private sector participation in key economic sectors.

Financial Mechanisms and Incentives

Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs): The government actively welcomes investors through PPPs for infrastructure development, energy projects, agricultural schemes, and other services. PPPs are seen as a way to reduce fiscal constraints and leverage private sector efficiency.

Tax Incentives: These include capital allowances, deductions on tax, and special allowances for investments in Special Economic Zones (SEZs), Export Processing Zones (EPZs), and industrial parks. Specific incentives for ICT firms include reduced income tax for expatriates, corporate tax holidays, withholding tax holidays on dividends, and VAT/customs import duty exemptions on inputs.

De-risking Instruments: The government and development partners are focusing on de-risking investments, especially in climate-sensitive sectors. This includes providing Partial Risk Guarantees (PRG) for investors, undertaking resource assessment and feasibility studies, and developing credit guarantee schemes/De-risking Funds for SMEs in agriculture.

Green Bonds: These are emerging tools to attract investment in environmental projects, such as sustainable land use and habitat restoration.
Climate Change Funds: The Climate Change Act establishes a Climate Change Fund, and County Climate Change Funds (CCCFs) are being set up to finance climate projects identified by local communities.

Blended Finance: This approach leverages concessional capital, blended finance, and technical assistance to de-risk perceived transaction risks and improve commercial viability, particularly in regions like the FCDC counties.

Institutional Support and Environment

Kenya Investment Authority (KenInvest): As Kenya's investment promotion agency, KenInvest provides advisory services, investment information, and project facilitation, assisting investors in obtaining necessary licenses, permits, and incentives.

Devolved Governance: The Constitution of Kenya (2010) established county governments, which have the mandate for local planning, budgeting, and implementation of development projects, including agriculture and disaster management. This devolution allows for localised innovation and collaboration, empowering local communities and creating new investment opportunities.
Focus on Specific Value Chains: The government is actively promoting investments in critical sectors and value chains such as agriculture (e.g., fisheries, livestock, dryland cereals, pulses, dairy), water (e.g., sustainable water harvesting, irrigation), and energy (e.g., geothermal, solar mini-grids, green hydrogen, clean cooking).

Digital Transformation: Significant investments have been made in expanding digital infrastructure and creating an enabling environment for technological innovations, with a focus on digital agriculture for extension services, subsidy delivery, and real-time monitoring.
These efforts aim to create a conducive and supportive environment for both local and foreign investors, driving economic growth and contributing to Kenya's sustainable development goals."
"Investment Challenges & De-risking: From an investor's perspective, what are the primary challenges or barriers to mobilizing private capital in Kenya's key sectors, and what strategies or financial instruments are being explored to de-risk these investments?","Kenya faces several significant challenges in mobilising private capital across its key sectors, yet it is actively exploring various strategies and financial instruments to de-risk these investments.

Primary Challenges and Barriers to Mobilising Private Capital:

Kenya's financial landscape is characterised by high perceived risk and relatively weak foreign private investment. Investors typically prefer well-established entities, which means early-stage or informal businesses often struggle to secure financing due to difficulties meeting stringent lending standards and a limited supply of genuinely bankable projects. A unique barrier is communal land ownership, which complicates the use of land as collateral for loans. 

Furthermore, the cost of capital is often prohibitive, and options for long-term finance remain limited. The due diligence processes are frequently complex and protracted, leading to ""process fatigues"" for entrepreneurs and investors alike.

The agricultural sector, despite its importance, is severely underfunded, accounting for a small fraction of total lending, and struggles with a high rate of non-performing loans. Broader economic concerns like unpredictable investment policies and forex shortages further deter international private investors.

Operationally, insecurity stemming from tribal clashes, political instability in neighbouring countries, and severe droughts impacts revenue collection and asset protection. High poverty levels in certain regions diminish their attractiveness for investment. Inadequate infrastructure, including roads, power, and water, at potential industrial sites also presents a substantial hurdle. Sector-specific issues include low private sector engagement in the water sector due to revenue uncertainty and a perceived unfavourable business environment. The energy sector faces high initial costs and a lack of specific county-level policies to guide investments.

Strategies and Financial Instruments for De-risking Investments:

To mitigate these risks and attract private capital, Kenya is implementing various strategies and financial instruments:

Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) are a core strategy, particularly for large-scale development projects such as integrated agro-industrial parks, transport, energy, and irrigation initiatives. These partnerships leverage private sector efficiency and expertise to address infrastructure deficits and reduce the financial burden on public budgets.

Blended Finance is increasingly used, combining commercial finance with grants or concessional debt, including climate-linked funds, to reduce perceived risks for private investors and mobilise additional capital.

Guarantees and Risk Insurance are vital de-risking tools. These include Credit Guarantee Schemes, Partial Risk Guarantees (PRGs) provided by the national government for renewable energy projects, and piloting weather-indexed livestock insurance schemes. Additionally, international bodies like MIGA (Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency) offer political risk insurance against risks like currency inconvertibility and expropriation.

Concessional Capital has seen increased usage to bridge the time lag between implementing new practices and achieving tangible results.

Investment Incentives, such as tax allowances and dedicated funds like the Biashara Fund, are offered to make investments more attractive.

New financing mechanisms are being explored, including carbon markets for selling carbon credits generated from climate-aligned sectors, and the issuance of Green Bonds to fund environmentally beneficial projects.

Sector-specific de-risking measures are tailored to address particular challenges. In agriculture, incentives for private sector investment in agricultural insurance are key, alongside promoting value addition through agro-processing. 

For the water sector, improving the governance and operational efficiency of Water Service Providers (WSPs) is crucial to enhance their bankability. In the energy sector, special Renewable Energy tariffs and Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) are in place to ensure investment returns.

Institutional and data improvements are also a focus, including strengthening stakeholder consultations, improving access to ICT and e-government services to reduce transaction costs, and developing comprehensive investment plans like the Kenya Climate Smart Agriculture Investment Plan (CSAIP) to identify and prioritise bankable investments."
ASAL Region Potential: What are the specific investment opportunities and inherent risks for private sector investment in Kenya's Arid and Semi-Arid Lands (ASALs)?,"Kenya's Arid and Semi-Arid Lands (ASALs) cover approximately 80% of the country's landmass and are home to 36% of Kenya’s population, 70% of its livestock, and 90% of its wildlife. Despite historically high poverty levels (over 60% in some areas), the ASALs offer significant investment opportunities for the private sector.

Specific Investment Opportunities:

Agriculture, Livestock & Fisheries:
The ASALs have a high potential for livestock production, holding 70% of the national herd. Opportunities exist in value addition through establishing modern abattoirs, meat processing plants, milk processing facilities, and leather tanneries.

There is significant potential for fodder production across expansive rangelands.
Large-scale irrigation projects are feasible, especially by utilizing vast groundwater resources like the Lotikipi Aquifer in Turkana. This can support various food and cash crops and contribute to food security.

Opportunities also exist in fish farming in oasis areas and fish processing industries along Lake Turkana, the Tana River, and the Indian Ocean.
Bee-keeping and honey value addition are promising.
Seed bulking for fodder grass and open-pollinated crop varieties is encouraged.

Energy:
The ASALs possess immense renewable energy potential from solar, wind, and geothermal sources. This includes major projects like the Lake Turkana Wind Power Project.

Investment in green energy can lead to job creation and opportunities for carbon-crediting and green growth.

Mining:

The region is endowed with diverse unexploited mineral resources, including gold, gypsum, limestone, rare earth elements, and potential oil and gas deposits.

Tourism & Wildlife:

ASALs offer untapped tourism potential with diverse attractions such as unique wildlife, cultural heritage, prehistoric sites (e.g., ""cradle of mankind"" in Turkana), and natural landscapes like Lake Turkana and the Chalbi Desert. Investments in hotels, eco-tourism, cultural tours, and sports tourism are viable.

Infrastructure & Connectivity:

Major national projects like the LAPSSET Corridor aim to spur economic development, creating opportunities in transport, logistics, and industrial parks.
Further investments are needed in roads, water infrastructure, and digital connectivity to bridge existing gaps.

Financial Services & Digital Agriculture:

Opportunities exist for blended finance solutions leveraging concessional capital, grants, and technical assistance. There's also demand for Shariah-compliant financial products and expanded credit access for SMEs and cooperatives, particularly in rural areas.

Development and upscaling of digital agricultural services (e.g., early warning systems, advisory, market information, financial services) can enhance productivity and resilience.

Inherent Risks for Private Sector Investment:

Climate Vulnerability: The ASALs are highly susceptible to recurrent droughts, erratic rainfall, high temperatures, and floods, leading to significant losses in agriculture and livestock. This exacerbates water scarcity and land degradation.
Insecurity & Conflict: Inter-communal conflict, cattle rustling, and resource-based conflicts (especially over water and land) are chronic issues, intensified by climate change and population growth. The presence of refugees can also strain limited resources.

Limited Access to Capital: The agriculture sector is often perceived as high-risk, leading to low investment by formal financial institutions. Smallholder farmers face challenges accessing credit due to lack of collateral (often communal land ownership) and high opportunity costs of capital. Significant financing gaps exist for development goals.

Inadequate Infrastructure & Services: A general lack of basic infrastructure (e.g., roads, electricity, piped water, ICT) increases operational costs for businesses and deters investment.

Policy & Governance Gaps: Challenges include lack of spatial plans, weak land tenure systems, insufficient staff capacity, and deficits in political goodwill. Unpredictable investment policies and poor project coordination also hinder progress.

Market & Value Chain Challenges: The agricultural sector's informal nature, unstructured value chains, limited processing capacity, and high post-harvest losses impede profit maximization for investors."
"General CIDP Purpose and Structure: What is the primary purpose of a County Integrated Development Plan (CIDP), and what are its main structural components as outlined in the sources?","A County Integrated Development Plan (CIDP) serves as a five-year master plan for a county's economic, social, environmental, legal, and spatial development, aiming to meet the service and infrastructural needs and targets for all local residents. It is the primary basis for budgeting and appropriation of funds within a county, ensuring that public funds are spent in alignment with the county's planning framework. CIDPs are developed under the guiding provisions of devolution laws, such as the County Government Act 2012 and the Public Finance Management Act 2012.

The primary purposes of a CIDP include:

To coordinate the efforts of the county government, national government, and other development partners to link economic, social, environmental, legal, and spatial aspects of development based on local community priorities and needs.
To guide development planning, budgeting, funding, monitoring, and evaluation of programmes and projects over a five-year term.

To translate people's aspirations into priorities, clear outcomes, output measures, and required resources to transform lives and livelihoods.

To accelerate the development agenda across various sectors, focusing on transforming and enhancing residents' livelihoods.

To integrate diverse aspects of planning, including economic, physical, social, environmental, and spatial planning, while promoting public participation.

To reflect and align with national development aspirations such as Kenya Vision 2030 and its Medium-Term Plans (MTPs), as well as regional and international development frameworks like the African Agenda 2063 and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

To serve as a crucial foundation for resource mobilisation and allocation, outlining the county's resource potential and providing a basis for attracting investment and partnerships.
To address prevailing development issues across all sectors, incorporating specific priorities and addressing challenges from previous planning periods.
To facilitate cooperation and synergy across sectors, actors, geographical areas, and levels of operation, ensuring programming is coherent, coordinated, and efficient, especially in areas like drought management.
The main structural components of a CIDP are typically organised into six chapters:
Chapter One: County Overview – This chapter provides background information on the county's position, size, physiographic and natural conditions (e.g., physical features, climate, ecology), administrative and political units, demographic features (including population size, composition, distribution, and projections), human development indicators, and the county's poverty profile.
Chapter Two: Performance Review of the Previous CIDP Period – This section reviews the implementation of the preceding CIDP, analysing county performance in terms of revenue sources and budget expenditures. It highlights key achievements, outcomes, and major challenges faced during implementation, along with lessons learned and an assessment of natural resources and development issues.
Chapter Three: Spatial Development Framework – This chapter presents the spatial framework guiding the implementation of development projects and programmes. It includes information on human settlements, growth centres, transportation networks, natural resources, social amenities, trade, commerce, industry, innovation, and county spatial development strategies. It often indicates progress made in the preparation of county spatial plans.
Chapter Four: Development Priorities, Strategies, and Programmes – This comprehensive chapter details the identified development needs, priorities, strategies, and specific programmes and flagship projects for each sector. It also outlines cross-sectoral linkages, anticipated impacts, mitigation measures, and the CIDP's contributions to national, regional, and international development frameworks.
Chapter Five: Implementation Framework – This section outlines the county's institutional arrangements and the specific roles of various stakeholders (e.g., County Executive Committee, County Assembly, National Government departments, development partners, civil society organisations, private sector) in CIDP implementation. It also presents the resource mobilisation and management framework, asset management strategies, and anticipated risks with their mitigation measures.
Chapter Six: Monitoring, Evaluation, and Learning (MEL) – This concluding chapter details the framework for tracking the progress of CIDP implementation. It includes the county's M&E structure, mechanisms for data collection, analysis, reporting, and dissemination, outlines outcome indicators and targets, and describes feedback mechanisms, citizen engagement, and evaluation plans.
These structural components provide a comprehensive roadmap for a county's development over the five-year period, ensuring accountability and citizen participation."
"County Financial Performance and Gaps: Analyse the performance of local revenue collection in Marsabit County from 2018-2022, identifying the variance between targeted and actual receipts.","In Marsabit County, the performance of local revenue collection between 2018 and 2022 consistently fell short of its targets, resulting in a cumulative deficit of approximately KSh 129.84 million.
Here's an analysis of the local revenue collection performance, including the targeted amounts, actual receipts, and the variances for each fiscal year:
FY 2018/2019:

The total collection under the county's own resources was KSh 475,161,173, against a target of KSh 605,000,000, representing 1.62% of the total funds received during the review period.
Factors Contributing to Low Revenue Collection: Several challenges significantly impacted the county's ability to meet its revenue targets:
Effects of COVID-19: The pandemic led to disruptions that negatively affected revenue generation.
Insecurity due to tribal clashes: Inter-tribal conflicts rocked the county for the entire period under review, slowing down development projects as funds were reallocated to address humanitarian emergencies.
Political instability in neighboring Ethiopia: This specifically affected cross-border trade, which is a source of revenue.
Severe drought: Successive four consecutive rain failures caused massive livelihood losses, including livestock deaths and crop failures, which impacted revenue.
Revenue leakages: Due to the expansive porous border, revenue leakages occurred.
Lack of new revenue bases: The county did not create any new revenue bases during this period.
Despite efforts and investments, such as developing an automated revenue system and a finance act, the overall revenue realized did not meet the targets. The county aims to increase its own source revenue in future periods through strategies such as automating revenue collection, capacity building for staff, preparing valuation rolls for urban areas, and putting proper enforcement mechanisms in place."
"Monitoring, Evaluation, and Learning (MEL) Frameworks: Describe the key components and purpose of Monitoring, Evaluation, and Learning (MEL) or M&E frameworks within the context of county integrated development plans.","Monitoring, Evaluation, and Learning (MEL) or M&E frameworks are integral to County Integrated Development Plans (CIDPs), providing a structured approach to track progress, assess performance, and ensure accountability and transparency in development initiatives [Marsabit CIDP, p. 50].

1. Purpose of M&E/MEL Frameworks in CIDPs:

Accountability and Transparency: M&E ensures that planned goals are achieved throughout development activity execution, providing information on resource allocation to promote transparency and hold implementers accountable to defined responsibilities and performance expectations [Marsabit CIDP, p. 50].

Evidence-Based Decision-Making: These frameworks offer crucial knowledge and evidence on investment performance, guiding managers, decision-makers, and other stakeholders through regular feedback on progress [Marsabit CIDP, p. 50]. Findings and lessons learned are shared with policymakers, beneficiaries, and the public to cultivate a results-driven culture [Marsabit CIDP, p. 50]. The effective management of knowledge aims to ensure evidence-based decision-making and practice [Common Framework for EDE, p. 165].

Improved Efficiency and Effectiveness: M&E facilitates early identification of problems, enabling timely corrective actions when projects deviate from their intended course [Marsabit CIDP, p. 50]. It ensures that lessons learned are applied to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of ongoing and future programmes [Marsabit CIDP, p. 50].

Coordination and Alignment: M&E promotes cooperation and synergy across various sectors, actors, geographical areas, and operational levels, leading to more coherent and efficient programming [Marsabit CIDP, p. 50]. It aligns county priorities with national aspirations, such as Kenya Vision 2030 and Medium-Term Plans, and international obligations like the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) [Marsabit CIDP, p. 50]. An inclusive and well-structured integrated planning framework enhances the linkage of policy, planning, and budgeting in county governance processes [Samburu CIDP, p. 257].

Resource Mobilisation and Management: M&E data informs budgeting and allocation processes, helping to identify resource gaps and devise strategies for additional resource mobilisation [Marsabit CIDP, p. 50]. Frameworks for resource mobilisation, financing, and insurance services are developed [Narok CIDP, p. 296]. Funds mobilised externally are measured as a key performance indicator for resource mobilisation [Taita-Taveta CIDP, p. 462].

2. Key Components of M&E/MEL Frameworks:
M&E Structure: Frameworks establish a hierarchy of committees and units responsible for M&E functions. This typically includes a County M&E Unit/Directorate (often within Finance and Economic Planning), County Monitoring and Evaluation Committees (CoMEC), Technical Oversight Committees (TOC), Sector Monitoring and Evaluation Committees (SMEC), Sub-County and Ward M&E Committees, and the Governor's Delivery Unit [Marsabit CIDP, p. 50]. The County Assembly also plays a role in planning and reviewing M&E reports, providing oversight and feedback [Marsabit CIDP, p. 50]. In Turkana, weaknesses in M&E structures are identified as a constraint [Turkana CIDP, p. 170].

M&E Capacity: Strengthening institutional and human resource capacities is crucial for effective M&E, encompassing financial and human resources, M&E dashboards, and digital platforms [Marsabit CIDP, p. 50]. This involves recruiting staff, training in modern data collection and analysis, and providing technical assistance to M&E committees [Marsabit CIDP, p. 50]. Investment in human capacity and institutional coordination is considered essential for efficient and accurate data collection and analysis [CSAIP Kenya, p. 142]. Budget training for stakeholders also forms part of capacity building [Laikipia CIDP, p. 117].

Data Collection, Analysis, and Reporting: Both quantitative and qualitative data are collected through various methods, including field observations, stakeholder meetings, interviews, surveys, questionnaires, and departmental progress reports [Marsabit CIDP, p. 50]. A CIDP Indicator Handbook and standard data templates are developed to guide collection [Marsabit CIDP, p. 50]. Technologies like Electronic County Integrated Monitoring and Evaluation Systems (e-CIMES) and web-based M&E systems facilitate real-time information, automated analysis, and report generation [Marsabit CIDP, p. 50]. Reports are prepared at various frequencies, including monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, and annually [Marsabit CIDP, p. 50]. Comprehensive data collection requires specifying the frequency and responsibilities for applying tools, analyzing relevant information, and reviewing it [CSAIP Kenya, p. 141].

Dissemination, Feedback Mechanism, Citizen Engagement, and Learning: M&E findings are disseminated through diverse channels such as public dialogue forums, county websites, social media platforms, M&E dashboards, mainstream media, and presentations by the Governor [Marsabit CIDP, p. 50]. Citizen engagement is vital for public participation, feedback, ownership, and accountability [Marsabit CIDP, p. 50]. Learning mechanisms are put in place to ensure insights are captured, shared, and applied to improve future planning and implementation [Marsabit CIDP, p. 50].

M&E Outcome Indicators and Results Matrices: CIDPs define specific outcome indicators and targets for various programmes and sectors to measure progress [Marsabit CIDP, p. 50]. These indicators are frequently linked to national targets (e.g., Kenya Vision 2030) and international frameworks (e.g., SDGs) [Marsabit CIDP, p. 50, Laikipia CIDP, p. 74]. The frameworks detail key outputs and key performance indicators [Marsabit CIDP, pp. 50-68].

Evaluation Plan: CIDPs incorporate a plan for periodic evaluations, including rapid evaluations, impact evaluations, and mid-term/end-term reviews of the CIDP or specific programmes/projects [Marsabit CIDP, p. 50]. These evaluations assess the relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, impact, and sustainability of interventions [Marsabit CIDP, p. 50]. Feasibility studies, often funded at the design stage, also contribute to assessing the viability of transactions [CSAIP Kenya, p. 137].

In essence, the M&E/MEL framework is a dynamic system designed to foster adaptive management, continuous learning, and robust accountability, ensuring that CIDPs effectively achieve their objectives and enhance the well-being of county residents [Marsabit CIDP, p. 50]."
"Demographic Dividend Strategies: Explain the concept of ""Demographic Dividend"" as understood in the county planning documents.","The concept of ""Demographic Dividend"" in the context of county planning documents refers to the accelerated economic growth that may result from a decline in a country's mortality and fertility rates, leading to a subsequent change in the age structure of the population. This phenomenon occurs when a county experiences lower birth rates (low fertility rates) in conjunction with low death rates (mortality rates).

Here's a breakdown of the concept and its implications for county development:

Population Age Structure Change: A decline in fertility levels leads to a reduction in the number of dependents (population below the age of 15) relative to the working-age population (typically 15-64 years). With fewer people to support and a larger proportion of people in the productive working ages, resources are freed up.

Economic Opportunity: This shift in age structure presents a temporary window of opportunity for potentially higher economic growth. The increased proportion of the population in working ages means more individuals are available to contribute to the economy. If these workers are healthy, educated, and skilled, and have adequate income and employment opportunities, their increased savings can be invested for the county's economic growth, ultimately improving residents' well-being.

Strategic Investments for Attainment: Achieving a demographic dividend is not automatic. Counties need to make simultaneous and strategic investments in several key areas to harness this potential:

Health and Well-being: This includes improving access to healthcare, nutrition, and water and sanitation services, and focusing on maternal and child health to reduce mortality rates.
Education and Skills Development: Investing in quality education, skills training, and information technology and communication is crucial to ensure the working-age population is productive and competitive.

Employment and Entrepreneurship: Creating job opportunities, promoting self-employment, and enhancing access to financial services are vital to absorb the growing labor force.

Rights, Governance, and Youth Empowerment: This involves ensuring good governance, accountability, and the participation of young people in decision-making.

County-Specific Contexts:

Marsabit County: Its population was 459,785 in 2019 and is projected to rise to 565,091 by 2027. The youthful population (below 19) accounts for 58% of the total, indicating a need for urgent investment in education, health, nutrition, and water. The proportion of the working-age population (15-64 years) is expected to increase from 50% to 56.19% by 2027, with the dependency ratio declining from 99.85 to 77.97. Marsabit emphasizes investments in health and well-being, education and skills development, employment and entrepreneurship, and rights, governance, and youth empowerment.

Turkana County: The population is projected to reach 1.13 million by 2027, up from 926,955 in 2019. The working-age population is expected to increase from 52.3% in 2019 to 56.9% in 2027, and the fertility rate is projected to decline to 5.8 by 2027 from 6.4 in 2019. This will result in a decrease in the dependency ratio from 0.91 to 0.76. Turkana also highlights the need for simultaneous strategic investments in health, education, economic, and governance sectors.

Laikipia County: Its demographic window is expected to open in 2036, when the proportion of the population under 15 years falls below 30%, and those aged 65 and above are still below 15%. The proportion of children below 15 is projected to decline from 37.62% in 2019 to 34.67% in 2027, while the working-age population is expected to increase from 58.42% in 2023 to 60.41% by 2027.

Kajiado County: The county's demographic dividend window of opportunity is projected to open in 2035, an improvement from the previous CIDP's projection of 2042. The working-age population is expected to increase from 59% to 64% by 2027, while the dependency ratio decreases from 0.69 to 0.55.
Samburu County: The demographic window is expected to open from 2046, based on a declining fertility rate. This period is seen as an opportunity for maximum economic growth due to a large labor force relative to the dependent population.

Overall, county planning documents emphasize that effectively harnessing the demographic dividend requires comprehensive, integrated planning and investment across multiple sectors to ensure a healthy, educated, and productive workforce."
Climate Change Risks and Water Adaptation: What adaptation strategies are proposed or being researched to enhance water security?,"To enhance water security, several adaptation strategies are being proposed or researched, primarily focusing on improving water availability, efficiency, infrastructure, governance, and community resilience, particularly in Kenya's arid and semi-arid lands (ASALs).
Key strategies and areas of research include:
Water Infrastructure Development


Construction and Rehabilitation: This involves developing new water sources such as boreholes (drilling and equipping, often with solar energy), mega dams, water pans, underground and masonry tanks, and rock catchments. There is also a focus on extending water pipelines to settlements and institutions. A critical aspect is the climate-proofing of new and rehabilitated water infrastructure.
Flood Control: Developing and promoting flood control infrastructure like dykes and check dams, and enhancing stormwater management and water harvesting are crucial for reducing disaster risks.
Water Storage: Strategies include promoting sustainable water harvesting, storage, and utilization systems to boost agricultural productivity and enhance resilience to droughts. This encompasses both traditional systems and modern technologies like dam liners and drip irrigation.
Efficient Water Use and Management


Water Efficiency: Promoting efficient water use, including recycling for various sectors. Specific measures involve reducing non-revenue water (NRW), installing pre-paid water meters for kiosks and bulk users, and undertaking research on water efficiency.
Integrated Water Resource Management (IWRM): Emphasizing integrated approaches to water catchment management, including forming and training Water Resources Users Associations (WRUAs).
Groundwater Exploration and Recharge


Conducting hydrogeological surveys and feasibility studies to identify groundwater potential.
Mapping groundwater resources in specific counties like Turkana, Marsabit, and Wajir to guide sustainable development.
Piloting artificial aquifer recharge techniques to increase groundwater supply.
Climate-Smart Agriculture and Fisheries


Promoting climate-smart agriculture practices, which involve improved extension services, research, and disease control.
Irrigation Technologies: Encouraging the adoption of water-saving irrigation technologies like drip irrigation and solar-powered pumps.
Fisheries: Enhancing climate-smart cage and pond fish farming, promoting sustainable harvesting, and establishing fish landing sites and processing plants.
Policy and Governance Frameworks


Developing and reviewing water policies, regulations, and master plans at both county and national levels.
Strengthening institutional capacity for water management at various levels.
Mainstreaming climate change into all county development plans and policies is a key objective.
Research and Data


Investing in research and development for climate-smart technologies and practices is highlighted across sectors.
Improving Data Systems: Enhancing early warning information formulation, dissemination, and utilization for timely action, increasing capacity to access and engage with water resources data, and conducting climate risk assessments.
Nature-Based Solutions (NBS): Researching the potential for NBS in water resource investments, such as mangrove and coral reef restoration. These solutions aim to reduce overland flow, buffer floods, increase groundwater recharge, and lessen erosion and sedimentation.


Financial Strategies: Mobilizing county, national, and international funds to address climate shocks through resilience interventions. This includes establishing climate finance frameworks, allocating a percentage of the development budget to climate change adaptation, resilience, and mitigation, and exploring private sector engagement and innovative financing mechanisms like green bonds and carbon credits.


For example, Marsabit County proposes allocating 2% of its development budget to climate change adaptation, resilience, and mitigation, and seeks funds from national and international climate change funds. The National Climate Change Action Plan (NCCAP) 2023–2027 identifies increasing annual per capita water availability through developing water infrastructure, including fast-tracking multipurpose dams and constructing water pans and climate-proofed underground reservoirs. The National Irrigation Sector Investment Plan (NISIP) also aims to expand equipped irrigation areas and optimize existing ones, with particular attention to ASAL regions for increased water storage and food/fodder production."
Prioritised Climate-Smart Agriculture (CSA) Investments: Identify and describe at least three different climate-smart agriculture investment areas prioritised in Kenya's CSAIP.,"Kenya's Climate-Smart Agriculture Investment Plan (CSAIP) prioritises a set of eight investments aimed at boosting agricultural resilience and enhancing yields for smallholder farmers across the country. These investments were identified through a stakeholder-informed process, building on Kenya's existing programs, policies, and strategic plans, including the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC).
Here are three of the prioritised climate-smart agriculture investment areas:
Climate-Smart Aquaculture and Fisheries:


Objective: This investment aims to improve farm-level productivity, diversify livelihoods and income, and enhance nutrition and food security in Kenya.
Associated Practices: Key practices include rearing quality fingerlings, diversifying farming activities by introducing vegetables, poultry, and fish production in typical rice monoculture systems, and using solar or wind power for water recirculation in aquaculture systems for large-scale, ecologically sustainable fish production. It also promotes adding value to fisheries and aquaculture products (e.g., fish sausages, samosas) and utilising idle Arid and Semi-Arid Lands (ASALs) saline borehole water for fish production to enhance food security in these regions.
Benefits: By adopting and scaling integrated aquaculture systems, Kenya can improve agricultural productivity, farm-level efficiency, and food and nutritional security, helping to satisfy the growing domestic demand for fish. Diversification also increases climate resilience and generates income opportunities for vulnerable smallholder farmers and fishers.
Alignment: This investment directly addresses the goals of Kenya's NDC, particularly in mitigating the impacts of rising sea temperatures on reef systems and coastal fisheries by supporting mangrove and coral reef restoration and replenishing fish breeding habitats. It also contributes to mainstreaming CSA to increase productivity and build resilience through sustainable natural resource management.
Climate-Smart Dairy Livestock Systems:


Objective: The primary goal is to improve the dairy sector's productivity to meet increasing demand, enhance the resilience of smallholder dairy farmers, and support the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the dairy livestock sector. This contributes to food and nutritional security, improved livelihoods, and climate change mitigation.
Associated Practices: Interventions include improving the production of live feeds, optimising feed formulation and management (including insect-based diet supplements), promoting genetic breeding and rearing of improved dairy livestock breeds, and fostering community-driven sustainable grazing management systems. Partnerships between the public and private sectors are also key for enhanced value addition, storage, and marketing of dairy livestock products.
Benefits: Through interventions in climate-smart dairy systems, Kenya can significantly reduce GHG emissions (by 20–36%) while simultaneously increasing milk productivity (by 30–35%). This investment was ranked highest in overall climate-smartness due to its impact on sequestering carbon and reducing methane emissions. It is considered a 'no-regret' option due to its positive economic returns.
Challenges: Kenya's dairy farming is highly sensitive to climate change impacts like erratic rainfall and temperature increases, leading to feed scarcity, heat stress for high-yielding breeds, and disease spread. The livestock sector is also the largest contributor to Kenya's total GHG emissions, with dairy cattle accounting for a significant portion.
Sustainable Water Harvesting, Storage, and Utilization Systems:


Objective: This investment aims to boost agricultural productivity, support the diversification of crops and diets, and increase the resilience of farming households to climate hazards such as droughts.
Associated Practices: Actions involve water harvesting and conservation, including tapping into stormwater runoff in basins and ponds to ensure a year-round water supply. It includes the construction of mega dams and rock catchments, desilting existing dams, and supporting community-based adaptation through nature-based solutions like agroforestry. Promoting irrigation by providing subsidies for water-efficient irrigation equipment and tools, and encouraging solar-powered irrigation systems, are also key aspects.
Benefits: These systems enable farmers to double output during dry seasons through irrigation and increase resilience to drought events. The investment also supports disaster risk reduction through flood risk management and enhanced drought resilience. The use of dam liners and drip irrigation, as examples of practices under this investment, have shown to be viable with positive economic returns.
Context: Kenya is a water-scarce country, with ASALs (89% of the country) receiving below-average rainfall, leading to severe water scarcity for farmers and agro-pastoral households. Only 3% of Kenya’s arable land is currently irrigated, with 80% of its irrigation potential untapped.
These prioritised investments reflect Kenya's strategic approach to address climate change impacts within its agricultural sector by focusing on increasing productivity, building resilience, and contributing to mitigation efforts."
"Integration of Public Participation: How is public participation emphasised and integrated into the formulation and ongoing implementation of county development plans, specifically referencing the number of forums held or the reporting mechanisms for citizen engagement?","Public participation is significantly emphasised and integrated into the formulation and ongoing implementation of county development plans, such as County Integrated Development Plans (CIDPs) [Previous Turn]. This commitment is anchored in constitutional and legal frameworks, including Article 220(2)(a) of the Constitution of Kenya, the Public Finance Management Act, 2012, the County Government Act, 2012, and the Urban Areas and Cities Act, 2012. These legislations mandate an integrated development planning structure that links policy, planning, and budgeting in county governance processes [305, Previous Turn], aiming for inclusive, transparent, and accountable governance [Previous Turn].

Emphasis and Integration into CIDP Formulation

County governments actively involve citizens and diverse stakeholders in the creation of their CIDPs through extensive consultative processes that are designed to be consultative, inclusive, and participatory [Previous Turn]. Development priorities, strategies, and programmes are directly identified from public participation forums, sectoral forums, and stakeholder forums [Previous Turn]. A specific emphasis is placed on ensuring youth participation and the inclusion of conventionally excluded groups like the poor, women, youth, nomadic households, and minority groups [Previous Turn].
Counties have outlined specific targets for public participation forums during CIDP formulation:

Laikipia County aims to increase citizen participation in CIDP/Annual Development Plan (ADP) fora from a baseline of 40% to 60% over five years. They specifically plan to hold 5 annual forums on the County development planning framework and 10 annual forums on county budget formulation.
Marsabit County intends to hold 100 joint public participation meetings for the County Planning and Budgeting Process over the five-year period (14 meetings annually). They also target 25 Governor's dialogue forums (5 annually). Furthermore, Marsabit County plans to increase public participation exercises for bills, budgets, and other planning documents to 175 from a baseline of 39, and community awareness and participation through civic education forums are projected to reach 9000 persons from a baseline of 1200.

Narok County has planned for 4 Public Participation meetings annually, for a total of 20 forums over five years.

Turkana County aims to conduct 4 Citizen Foras annually, leading to a total of 20 forums over the five-year period, with a baseline of 0.

Emphasis and Integration into Ongoing Implementation

Public participation extends beyond the formulation stage into the ongoing implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of development plans [Previous Turn]. Counties employ various reporting and feedback mechanisms to ensure continuous citizen engagement:
M&E findings and progress reports are regularly disseminated through public dialogue forums [Previous Turn].

Reports are uploaded to county websites for public access, and mainstream media, including newspapers, local radio, and television, are used for communication and sensitisation [Previous Turn].

Formal reporting mechanisms include quarterly, annual, and end-of-plan period M&E reports that are prepared and disseminated to the public and stakeholders. Some reports are also planned to be translated into vernacular languages and braille for broader accessibility [Previous Turn].

The County Integrated Monitoring and Evaluation System (CIMES) and e-CIMES are utilised for data collection, analysis, and automated report generation, ensuring transparency [Previous Turn].

Feedback and Response Systems (FRS) are established to facilitate two-way communication, allowing citizens to provide feedback through various channels, with commitments for timely responses from departments [Previous Turn].

Laikipia County aims for a significant increase in the percentage level of complaints/compliments received and resolved, targeting an improvement from 80% to 85%. Their supply chain management services plan the formulation and sharing of 20 quarterly and 5 annual supply chain management reports.
Marsabit County has an objective to submit reports to the County Assembly (CA). They also intend to use local radios for community sensitisation on activities and emerging issues, with 10 sessions on air in the first year and 15 in subsequent years, amounting to 75 sessions over five years.
Isiolo County plans to sensitise 1000 persons annually on rules and regulations for rural water and sanitation services, accumulating to 5000 persons. They also target sensitising 100 community members annually on child rights and training 4 trainer of trainees annually on drug and substance abuse.
Samburu County plans 2 stakeholder forums on responsible waste management in the first three years, increasing to 3 forums in the last two years. They also aim to conduct 1 climate information dissemination public forum annually for five years.
Taita Taveta County references an increase in the ""Number of meetings held"" for oversight purposes, rising from a baseline of 25 to 290 meetings over five years. They also detail ""Number of persons reached"" and ""Number of persons trained"" for community sensitisation and empowerment initiatives."
"Disaster Risk Management (DRM) Framework: Summarise the key strategies and expected results for strengthening disaster risk management at national and county levels, as articulated in the Ending Drought Emergencies (EDE) framework and county plans.","The Ending Drought Emergencies (EDE) framework outlines key strategies and expected results for strengthening disaster risk management (DRM) at both national and county levels, moving from a reactive approach to one focused on reducing vulnerability and building resilience. County Integrated Development Plans (CIDPs) serve as the primary instruments for localizing these DRM efforts.

National-Level Strategies and Expected Results:
The EDE framework's Pillar 5 specifically addresses Drought Risk Management, focusing on strengthening the institutional and financing framework for DRM. This pillar is underpinned by three components: drought risk and vulnerability reduction, drought early warning and early response, and institutional capacity for drought and climate resilience.

Institutional and Policy Strengthening:
The EDE framework prioritises the development and strengthening of institutional and legal frameworks for DRR, climate change adaptation (CCA), and social protection (SP) across all governance levels.
This includes the enactment of the Disaster Risk Management Bill and the operationalisation of the National Disaster Risk Management Authority (NDMA). The NDMA is established as a permanent, specialist government institution to lead and coordinate drought management in Kenya, working closely with county governments and various partners.

The NCCAP 2023-2027 aims to establish DRM Institutions and Centres of Excellence and develop a legal and policy framework for Emergency Medical Care during disasters.

Early Warning and Response Systems:
A critical strategy is to strengthen and operate the national drought early warning system (EWS), ensuring that accurate and timely information is collected, analysed, and disseminated.
The NCCAP 2023-2027 plans to establish and operationalise an Integrated Multi-hazard Early Warning, Information and Knowledge Management System at national and county levels. This also involves developing early warning and anticipatory action capacities that leverage relevant technologies and innovations.
Expected results include having an enhanced EWS operational in 23 counties and establishing common indices, triggers, and objective thresholds for response, agreed upon and used by all stakeholders.

Contingency Planning and Financing:
The framework facilitates systems for drought contingency planning and financing, notably through the operationalisation of the National Drought Contingency Fund (NDCF), a multi-donor facility designed to provide set-aside funds for timely response.
Strategic investments in drought preparedness are also planned, such as developing strategically located dry-season boreholes, community-based animal feed and seed banks, and livestock marketing infrastructure.
Expected results include updated drought contingency planning systems fully operational in all ASAL counties and national and county contingency financing systems complementing each other.

Knowledge Management and Coordination:
The EDE framework underscores the importance of effective knowledge management for evidence-based decision-making. This involves developing national standards and procedures for DRM and creating an open platform for sharing information and knowledge.
It aims to improve the coordination and delivery of disaster risk management by developing and strengthening coordination frameworks and mechanisms at national and county levels, as well as community-managed DRM. Expected outputs include a web-based knowledge platform and national standards adopted for DRM.

County-Level Strategies and Expected Results:
County governments play a pivotal role in implementing DRM interventions, as they are often the first responders due to their proximity and accountability to affected populations.

Integration into CIDPs:
County governments are mandated to develop County Integrated Development Plans (CIDPs) which integrate economic, social, environmental, legal, and spatial aspects of development. These plans are essential for mainstreaming EDE commitments and ensuring adequate financial allocations in county budgets.
For example, the Laikipia CIDP aims to fast-track the gazettement and implementation of its Disaster Risk Management Act and review/operationalise its County DRM Policy. The Isiolo CIDP indicates that DRM priorities are to be mainstreamed into annual sector plans.

Capacity Building:
Counties are committed to strengthening human resource development and building the capacity of staff on Community Managed Disaster Risk Reduction (CMDRR) and response.
For instance, Turkana County aims to conduct DRM Trainings using gender and vulnerability sensitive tools. Laikipia County also focuses on the modernisation of fire response services and building the capacity of fire response teams.
Counties, such as Marsabit and Turkana, are strengthening their Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) capacity through dedicated M&E units, trained staff, and the use of integrated digital platforms like e-CIMES and GIS labs to track project implementation and facilitate timely reporting.

Localised Preparedness and Response:
Counties aim to develop and review multi-hazard contingency plans.
Expected results include adoption of appropriate early warning systems for improved preparedness and response to climatic hazards.
Specific interventions include reducing the impact of disasters through restocking livestock and providing relief food supplies to households, water trucking, and destocking operations.
Turkana County's plan includes gathering and disseminating EWS reports, conducting Multi-Hazard mapping assessments, distributing family emergency kits, and implementing cash transfers.
Marsabit County also focuses on enhancing county preparedness and response for pests and diseases control and strengthening crop and livestock pest and disease control management.
Resource Mobilisation and Management:
Counties are actively pursuing resource mobilisation strategies to address financial gaps for development programmes. This involves strategic planning for programme funding, engagement with development partners, and improving own-source revenue collection.
Some counties, like Laikipia, are working to formulate and implement a Disaster Risk Reduction Fund.

Synergies and Challenges:
The EDE framework stresses a multi-sectoral and multi-agency approach for DRM, acknowledging that risks often extend beyond administrative boundaries, necessitating inter-county collaboration. Challenges include limitations in data availability, insufficient flexibility in planning and resource allocation, the need for robust contingency financing, and the complexity of stakeholder coordination. Despite these hurdles, the advent of devolution presents a significant opportunity to bring services closer to citizens and foster equitable development, positioning county governments as vital first responders in disaster management."
"Human Capital Development in ASALs: What are the main problems in healthcare and education in ASAL counties, and how does the EDE Common Programme plan to fix them to create a healthy and skilled workforce?""","The Arid and Semi-Arid Lands (ASALs) counties face significant challenges in healthcare and education, which directly impact the development of a healthy and skilled workforce. The Ending Drought Emergencies (EDE) Common Programme framework for Human Capital aims to address these issues through targeted interventions.
Main Problems in Healthcare and Education in ASAL Counties:
Healthcare:
Inadequate Access and Quality: Health services are often irregular, unreliable, under-resourced, remote, and of low quality. This includes sparsely distributed health facilities.
Human Resource Gaps: There is an acute shortage of skilled healthcare workers and a high vacancy rate (e.g., 79% in ten northern counties in 2012), making it difficult to attract and retain staff in remote areas. Doctor-patient ratios are very low, such as 1:13,000 in Marsabit County.
Poor Infrastructure: Health facilities often lack adequate infrastructure and equipment, and poor road networks further limit access to care.
Inadequate Funding: Budgetary allocations for the health sector are often below recommended targets, leading to insufficient funding for essential services.
High Disease Burden: ASALs experience high rates of malnutrition (e.g., Marsabit with 14% wasted and 31.7% stunted children), high maternal and neonatal mortality, and significant HIV prevalence in some areas.
Socio-cultural Barriers: Low health-seeking behaviour exists due to high costs and a preference for traditional practices.
Commodity Insecurity: Frequent stock-outs of essential health products and technologies (HPTs) limit service provision.
Education:
Low Enrolment and Literacy Rates: Primary enrolment rates are often below 50% in several northern counties, compared to a national average of 95.6%. Female literacy rates can be extremely low (below 10% in Mandera and Wajir).
High Teacher-Pupil Ratios: There is a significant shortage of teachers, leading to high teacher-pupil ratios, for example, 1:285 in Turkana and 1:55 in Isiolo ECDEs.
Inadequate Infrastructure and Resources: Schools are often poorly resourced, with insufficient classrooms, learning materials, tools, and equipment, particularly in Early Childhood Development Education (ECDE) and Vocational Training Centres (VTCs).
Negative Attitudes Towards VTCs: Communities sometimes hold negative perceptions towards technical and vocational education and training, contributing to low enrolment.
Socio-cultural Factors: Mobility, long distances to schools, cultural attitudes, domestic burdens, and issues like teenage pregnancies affect school attendance and quality of learning.
Limited Funding: Insufficient budget allocation affects the implementation of education programmes.
EDE Common Programme Solutions to Create a Healthy and Skilled Workforce:
The EDE Common Programme for Human Capital (Pillar 3) aims to foster a healthy, skilled, innovative, resourceful, and motivated human capital in ASALs. This is crucial for strengthening resilience to drought and providing a foundation for sustainable livelihoods and economic growth.
The framework focuses on three main components:
Increasing the capacity and number of appropriately trained and experienced professionals:


Establishing key institutions: This includes setting up the National Council on Nomadic Education in Kenya (NACONEK) and the Health and Nutrition Council for ASALs to lead strategies and harmonise approaches in the region.
Addressing Staffing Challenges: Developing a harmonised inter-county approach for staff recruitment, training, and retention in ASALs, including affirmative action measures for ASAL students in higher education.
Strengthening Referral Systems: Promoting appropriate health referral mechanisms, such as establishing an emergency and referral desk unit and providing ambulances.
Integrating alternative interventions into current systems:


Leveraging Technology: Establishing e-health (including telemedicine) for diagnostic services in remote areas and e-learning/distance education for continuous professional development.
Real-time Monitoring: Implementing systems for real-time monitoring of social services, particularly during emergencies.
Developing Surge Mechanisms: Creating flexible systems for health and education that can expand and contract service provision during drought periods.
Increasing community demand for equitable and quality services:


Community-Based Services: Strengthening mobile and community-based systems, including mobile clinics and mobile schools, to reach underserved populations.
Knowledge Sharing: Funding annual/semi-annual exchange programmes for communities to spread innovative and effective practices.
Financial Incentives: Establishing a fund for conditional cash transfers for health and education services to vulnerable populations.
The programme also incorporates cross-cutting issues such as mainstreaming HIV/AIDS interventions, promoting conflict-sensitive programming due to high insecurity, and ensuring nutrition is addressed as a multi-sectoral issue. By addressing these structural causes of vulnerability, the EDE aims to ensure that healthy and educated people in ASALs can better withstand shocks and contribute to economic development."
Digital Transformation & ICT Investment: What is Kenya's vision for a digital superhighway and creative economy?,"Kenya's vision for a digital superhighway and creative economy is a core component of the government's Bottom-Up Economic Transformation Agenda (BETA) and aligns with the broader Kenya Vision 2030, which aims to transform Kenya into a newly industrialising, middle-income country by 2030.

Key Aspects of the Vision and Goals:
The primary goal is to create economic opportunities for the population and reduce reliance on economic sectors that are vulnerable to climate shocks.
Kenya aims to increase the overall contribution of the digital and traditional economy to 10% of GDP by 2030.
The Digital Economy Blueprint, launched in 2019, outlines Kenya's objective to achieve a successful and sustainable digital economy.
This vision also supports Kenya's ambition for low-carbon climate-resilient development by providing tools and information for adaptation and resilience.

Planned Investments and Initiatives:
Extensive Fibre Optic Network: A significant plan involves laying a 100,000 kilometre fibre optic connectivity network, extending to counties, villages, schools, and over 24,000 businesses and homes. Collaboration with the national government on initiatives like the National Optic Fibre Backhaul Initiative (NOFBI) is part of this.
Digital Agricultural Services: There is a focus on developing and upscaling bundled digital agricultural services for smallholder farmers to boost resilience and enhance yields. These services include:
Early warning systems for climate-related hazards and food system risks.
Advisory and market information to improve farmers' knowledge base and decision-making.
Financial services, such as credit and insurance, to enhance financial inclusion for smallholder farmers.
E-commerce services to create market access opportunities for farmers.
Support for digitally enabled extension systems and real-time monitoring of strategic food reserves.
e-Government Transformation: County governments are actively working to improve ICT and align their service delivery with e-government strategies, aiming to increase the proportion of automated county services.
IT Infrastructure Upgrades: This includes modernising IT infrastructure within government offices to enhance business system availability and continuity, involving power backup, data centres, VOIP, and universal Wi-Fi access.

Promoting Digital Innovation: The government encourages the rise of digital capital provision companies (fintech) to channel funds into crucial sectors like agriculture. For example, the government has partnered with private actors in the telecom and banking sectors to implement initiatives like the Hustler Fund on a technological platform.
Challenges to Implementation:
Digital Divide: A significant barrier is the low level of digital literacy, particularly among rural smallholder farmers, which hinders the uptake of digital solutions, especially when they are primarily in English.
Infrastructure Gaps: Improvements are still needed in the availability and connectivity of basic infrastructure, such as electricity access, 4G coverage, and broadband.
Demand-Side Issues: Digital solutions are sometimes introduced based on technology push rather than latent demand, leading to challenges in adoption if they do not clearly add value for farmers.
Policy and Legal Frameworks: While there's heavy investment, a specific policy, legal, and institutional framework is still lacking to fully support the digitalisation of Kenya's agrifood system."
"Diverse Resource Mobilisation: Beyond the equitable share and conditional grants, what comprehensive strategies do county governments plan to establish for resource mobilisation?","County governments plan to establish several comprehensive strategies for resource mobilisation beyond equitable share and conditional grants, focusing on enhancing their Own Source Revenue (OSR), leveraging Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs), and securing additional external funding.

#### General Development Challenges:

* **Water Scarcity and Quality:**
  The county is generally arid and semi-arid, leading to water scarcity. The Ewaso Ng'iro River, a vital water source, is over-utilised upstream and is potentially threatened by proposed dam projects, which could significantly reduce its flow. Additionally, there are issues with poor groundwater quality, including salinity and high mineralisation, sometimes exceeding allowable limits, leading to the abandonment of some boreholes.

* **Insecurity:**
  Insecurity in the rangelands, often exacerbated by the influx of pastoralists from neighbouring counties, leads to vandalism of infrastructure like boreholes and resource-based conflicts over water and pasture.

* **Inadequate Infrastructure:**
  The county suffers from minimal infrastructural development, rough terrain in certain areas that hinders project implementation, and poor municipal infrastructure affecting service delivery.

* **Financial Constraints:**
  Inadequate funding impacts land mapping, adjudication processes, and the energy sector. Delayed fund disbursements and low budget absorption rates further limit development.

* **Human Capital and Capacity Gaps:**
  There is a lack of technical capacity in areas like land surveying and municipal management, and insufficient personnel and research in the energy sector. The county's overall literacy level and Human Development Index are below national averages. Capacity gaps within county governance units also hinder effective implementation of climate-smart agriculture (CSA) interventions.

* **Policy and Legal Framework Gaps:**
  There is a need for more robust legal frameworks and by-laws for municipal management and tourism. A notable absence is a comprehensive County Energy Master Plan. Insecure land tenure also limits private sector financing.

* **Market and Value Chain Issues:**
  Agriculture faces challenges such as poor market linkages, low value addition, and high post-harvest losses.

* **External Shocks:**
  The COVID-19 pandemic significantly disrupted project implementation, diverting resources and slowing progress. Locust invasions also pose a threat to food security.

#### Livestock Sector Specific Issues:

* **Feed Inadequacy:**
  A major challenge is the inadequate availability and access to livestock feeds, compounded by limited rehabilitation of rangelands and degraded rangelands. This is severely worsened by successive drought episodes.

* **Low Productivity:**
  Issues include low adoption of modern value addition technologies, poor livestock husbandry practices, and a lack of vibrant markets and reliable sources of good breeds. Overstocking and poor livestock distribution due to insecurity also depress productivity.

* **Disease Management:**
  The sector struggles with endemic livestock diseases, prevalent vectors and pests, extensive livestock movements leading to disease spread, and low vaccination coverage. Veterinary services are hampered by insufficient resource allocation and inadequate technical staff.

* **Financial Access:**
  Limited funding allocation and high capital outlay requirements for livestock infrastructure development constrain the sector. Access to financial services for farmers is limited due to factors like nomadic lifestyles and lack of collateral.

#### Energy Sector Specific Issues:

* **Low Renewable Energy Uptake:**
  Isiolo experiences low adoption of renewable energy technologies due to insufficient investment, lack of a master plan, inadequate infrastructure, limited data for investments, and a shortage of personnel and research in the sector.

* **High Initial Costs:**
  The initial capital costs for developing renewable energy projects are high, deterring investment.

* **Limited Access to Electricity:**
  A significant portion of Isiolo County's population (85%) still relies on solid fuels for cooking, and less than 30% have access to electricity. Many areas depend on expensive generators or isolated grids.

Human Development & Investment Nexus: How is human development measured in Kenyan counties?,"**Human development in Kenyan counties** is primarily measured through a set of indicators that collectively form the Human Development Index (HDI), along with other complementary indices and poverty analyses.

The human development paradigm is centred on the idea of enriching people's lives by expanding their options and choices, which includes increasing access to knowledge and skills, improving nutrition and health, and enhancing basic social services and secure livelihoods. It recognises that a society's true wealth lies in its people and promotes people-centred and integrated development through economic, social, and political empowerment.

---

### The main components used to measure human development at the county level include:

---

#### **Human Development Index (HDI):**

This is a composite statistic that assesses long-term progress in three fundamental dimensions of human development:

* **A long and healthy life:**
  Measured by life expectancy at birth.

* **Access to knowledge:**
  Measured by adult literacy rate, combined enrolment ratio at primary, secondary, and tertiary levels, mean years of schooling among the adult population, and expected years of schooling for children of school-entry age.

* **A decent standard of living:**
  Measured by Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita (or Gross National Income (GNI) per capita) in purchasing power parity (PPP).

**Examples:**

* Marsabit County's HDI: **0.4375** vs National average: **0.575**
* Laikipia County (2019): **0.574** vs National level: **0.601**
* Narok County: **0.51** vs National average: **0.52**
* Kajiado County (2021): **0.59**, slightly higher than national value **0.575**

---

#### **Youth Development Index (YDI):**

This tool tracks changes in the situation of young people and acknowledges their contributions to growth and development.
It measures progress across six domains:

* Health and Wellbeing
* Education
* Employment and Opportunity
* Political and Civic Participation
* Equality and Inclusion
* Peace and Security

**Example:**

* Laikipia's YDI (2020): **0.5952**, above national index of **0.577**

---

#### **Gender Inequality Index (GII):**

This index reflects disparities related to gender.

---

#### **Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI):**

This extends beyond the standard HDI to account for inequalities within the dimensions of human development.

---

#### **Climate Vulnerability Index (CVI):**

Used in some counties (e.g., **Turkana**) to measure human development in the context of climate change.

---

#### **Poverty Analysis:**

* **Monetary poverty rate:**

  * Turkana: **78.5%**, vs national rate **35.7%**
  * Marsabit: **63.2%**

* **Multidimensional poverty rate:**

  * Turkana: **86.3%** (higher than its monetary poverty rate)
  * Marsabit: **85.8%**
    Multidimensional poverty includes factors like housing, nutrition, information access, education, and sanitation.

---

#### **Demographic Dividend Potential:**

This assesses the potential for economic growth resulting from a shift in the population's age structure due to declining fertility and mortality rates.

Achieving this potential requires strategic investments in:

* Health and wellbeing
* Education and skills development
* Employment and entrepreneurship
* Rights, governance, and youth empowerment

---

### County Integrated Development Plans (CIDPs)

CIDPs serve as a framework for:

* Planning

  * Kenya’s NDC prioritises **adaptation**, but most climate finance has historically favoured **mitigation**.
  * There’s an urgent need for **scaling international investments in adaptation**, which requires innovative models.

---

**Overall**, Kenya demonstrates a strong commitment to establishing comprehensive policy and regulatory frameworks that align with its national development aspirations and international obligations, albeit facing ongoing challenges in full implementation, coordination, and financing."
Evolution and Harmonisation of M&E Systems: Trace the evolution or emphasis of Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) systems from the broader EDE framework to specific county CIDPs and national climate action plans.,"**The emphasis on Monitoring and Evaluation (M\&E) systems** has evolved from the broader Ending Drought Emergencies (EDE) framework to more specific and detailed approaches within national climate action plans and individual county-level County Integrated Development Plans (CIDPs).

---

### **Evolution from EDE Framework**

The EDE Common Programme Framework, aimed at building drought resilience, positions M\&E as a critical **""Pillar 6: Institutional Development and Knowledge Management.""** Its M\&E mandate is to track progress towards the 10-year EDE goal and the outcomes of its various pillars.

* **Shared Responsibility and Capacity Building**
  The framework anticipates that M\&E activities will promote shared learning and enhance the M\&E responsibilities and capacities of county governments to achieve their CIDPs.

* **Addressing Challenges**
  It acknowledges challenges such as limitations in data reliability and accessibility, the complexity of attributing outcomes, and the need for long-term monitoring mechanisms for changes that manifest over extended periods.

* **System Development**
  The EDE framework planned for the development of a Management Information System (MIS) for EDE M\&E, facilitating online reporting from counties into an integrated system.
  It also included plans for participatory reviews of results frameworks, baseline studies, and comprehensive programme evaluations.

---

### **Emphasis in National Climate Action Plans**

National climate action plans, such as the **Kenya Climate-Smart Agriculture Investment Plan (CSAIP)**, the **Kenya Climate Smart Infrastructure Improvement Framework (KCSAIF)**, and the **National Climate Change Action Plan (NCCAP)**, place a strong emphasis on M\&E to guide climate action and track progress against national and international commitments.

* **Foundational for Decision-Making**
  For the CSAIP, M\&E is considered a ""foundational activity"" that provides evidence on investment performance, informs adjustments in implementation, and lays the groundwork for an operational system delivering reliable, up-to-date progress information.

* **User-Centered and Holistic**
  The CSAIP M\&E strategy adopts a user-centered, holistic approach, embedding indicators within stakeholder-defined narratives to unlock productivity, adaptation, and mitigation outcomes.
  It advocates for a systematic and standardized approach that includes baseline data and consistent measurements to ensure accountability, enable benchmarking, and support adaptive actions.

* **Alignment with National and Global Frameworks**
  These national plans explicitly link their M\&E efforts to existing national policies and international commitments, such as:

  * **Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs)**
  * **National Adaptation Plans (NAPs)**
  * **Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)**
  * Global climate finance mechanisms like the **Green Climate Fund (GCF)** and **Adaptation Fund**

* **Measurement, Reporting and Verification Plus (MRV+)**
  The **NCCAP 2023–2027** highlights the establishment of an **MRV+** system to track adaptation and mitigation actions and benefits, including the collection of gender-disaggregated baseline data.
  It mandates county governments to operationalise climate change planning and budgeting, mainstreaming these actions into their **CIDPs** and reporting annually to the **County Assembly** and the **Climate Change Directorate**.

---

### **Integration and Implementation in County CIDPs**

County **CIDPs** generally reflect the national M\&E guidelines, including the **County Integrated Monitoring and Evaluation Systems (CIMES)** and **Kenya Evaluation Guidelines**.

* **Standardised Structures and Tools**
  Across counties like **Marsabit**, **Laikipia**, **Turkana**, **Isiolo**, **Kajiado**, and **Taita-Taveta**, the emphasis is on establishing defined M\&E structures, including committees at county, sub-county, ward, and sometimes village levels.
  They plan to develop **CIDP Indicator Handbooks** and increasingly utilise electronic systems like **e-CIMES** for data collection, analysis, and reporting.

* **Focus on Outcomes and Learning**
  CIDPs detail the production of quarterly and annual M\&E reports, as well as mid-term and end-term evaluations, to assess progress against planned targets and inform future planning and budgeting.
  There is a growing recognition of the **""learning""** component of M\&E to capture what works effectively and what doesn't, preventing loss of institutional knowledge when staff leave.

* **Capacity Building and Citizen Engagement**
  All counties acknowledge the importance of strengthening M\&E capacity through training of staff and committees.
  **Citizen participation** in M\&E activities is also a consistent theme, aiming to enhance transparency and ensure accountability.

* **Varying Implementation Maturity**
  While most counties demonstrate a robust framework, some, like **Narok**, explicitly identify weaknesses in their existing M\&E systems, citing:

  * Inadequate capacity
  * Lack of customised performance indicators
  * Insufficient facilitation of internal monitoring

  This highlights a varied maturity in the implementation of these evolving M\&E mandates across county governments.

---

**In summary**, the evolution shows a progression from a broad framework in the EDE to increasingly detailed, legally mandated, and technologically integrated M\&E systems within national climate action plans and county CIDPs.
The emphasis has shifted towards not only tracking outputs but also rigorously evaluating **outcomes and impacts**, with a strong focus on:

* **Data quality**
* **Disaggregation (e.g., by gender)**
* **Ensuring local-level implementation**

...for adaptive management and accountability in climate-related interventions."
