Q2,"Investment Challenges & De-risking: From an investor's perspective, what are the primary challenges or barriers to mobilizing private capital in Kenya's key sectors, and what strategies or financial instruments are being explored to de-risk these investments?","Investing in Kenya's key sectors, such as agriculture, presents several challenges. These include limited access to credit, with only 3.2% of Kenyan farmers using formal borrowing for their operations. Other challenges include high opportunity costs of capital, limited supply of bankable businesses, communal land ownership hindering the use of land as collateral, prohibitive cost of capital, and limited options for long-term finance. Furthermore, many Kenyan enterprises lack the necessary documentation for due diligence, making the investment process complex and elongated [citation:1][citation:2][citation:3].

To de-risk these investments, various strategies and financial instruments are being explored. For instance, blended finance, which pools different capital sources from public and private sectors, is seen as a potential solution. However, this approach faces challenges such as disconnects on funding cycles and",13.864081621170044,40,No,,nan,nan,nan,nan,"CHAPTER 3: INVESTMENT LANDSCAPE IN KENYA

3.3  Challenges to Mobilizing Private Sector Climate-
Response Financing in Kenya
The ease of accessing credit largely determines where to source capital to finance agriculture.  Many farmers 
have limited choices in this respect. Only 3.2 percent of Kenyan farmers use formal borrowing to finance their agricultural 
operations.126 Figure 14 summarizes several challenges to formal borrowing. With Kenya’s agriculture sector projected to 
grow by 6.3 percent in 2022, efforts to increase lending to this critical segment of the economy will need to be enhanced. 
Such efforts, however, will only be effective when there are systems in place to accurately measure and report on actual 
lending to the sector. Accurate data on lending to the agriculture sector is critical in informing development interventions

SUPPLY OF CAPITAL 
Overview 
Despite the steady economic growth in Kenya, the obvious disconnect between credit to the private sector and 
economic growth in the recent past presents a conundrum.7 The challenge of access to capital in Kenya is the 
preference for both investors and financial institutions to fund well-established entities with high governance 
standards and stable cash flows. The FCDC region faces the following challenges in accessing capital: 
• Generally, investment prospects are early-stage investments or MSMEs that do not meet the lending 
standards of banks with regards to governance and cash flows. 
• The World Bank designates Kenya as a lower middle-income country, projected to reach upper middle-
income status by 2030. By contrast, most of the FCDC counties have a high poverty index, leading to 
much higher difficulty accessing capital. Although banking and finance form a major part of Kenya’s

companies. Investment options include accelerator and co-working options, challenge funds, online fundraising 
platforms, corporate sector programs, summits, and conferences. Although most of these opportunities are based 
in Nairobi, select programs, including Start-up Lions, Turkana Catalyst Initiative, and Kakuma-Kalobeyei 
Challenge Fund (KKCF) are based in the FCDC region. Both state and private bodies in Kenya provide research 
data, training and capacity building, grants, sector interventions, and policy formation support to improve the 
investment environment. In addition, the government provides investment support services and regulatory 
supervision. 
National and county government incentives are key drivers of the investment environment. They include capital 
allowances and deductions on tax due from investors, and special allowances for special economic zones (SEZ),

activities. There is an urgent need for international investors to scale their investments in adaptation sectors, which 
requires more innovative financing models. 
Investment from the private sector totaled KES 98.9 billion (US$979 million) in 2021. Of this, 34.4 percent 
originated from Kenyan companies through their own resources, while 65.6 percent came from overseas private 
companies investing in projects in Kenya. Private finance represents almost 41 percent of total climate finance tracked in 
Kenya, and most of this was directed to renewable energy generation. A Global Impact Investing Network (GIIN) report121 
assessing impact investment in East Africa finds that most non-DFI impact investors have expressed interest in agriculture 
and financial services as target sectors. These two sectors also received over 40 percent of all deals in Kenya.

Figure 14: Challenges in Accessing Agricultural Finance in Kenya128  
Beyond the agricultural investment challenges (Figure 14), other challenges are stemming the flow 
of committed climate capital in Kenya. The below overview of key challenges relates to most sectors, including 
agriculture. Firstly, organizational siloes and competing mandates outcompete climate priorities. Secondly, government 
agencies and DFIs were initially designed for a suite of objectives that did not include combatting climate change. As such,

tax revenues, development partners, private sector, and through Public Private Partnerships 
(PPP).  
The government has put in place strategies to improve investment environment in the 
country. These strategies include enacting necessary legislations as well as strengthening 
institutions to support growth of investment through implementing major legal and 
institutional reforms that will provide a better environment for sustained macro-economic 
stability and improved management of public resources.

Cooperative in collaboration with line ministries and Kenya Investment Authority

● Tax incentives not as common in the agricultural

In Step 2, we mapped and profiled agricultural investments made in the previous 3 years in Kenya. This 
was followed by selecting a sample of impact investing transactions to further analyze the drivers and constraints to 
sustainable finance flow to the agricultural sector. Recent investments were defined as those conducted in the past 3 
years, between 2018 and 2021. The analysis was made more granular by analyzing investments made by commercial 
investors in a blended finance model, reflecting likely impact investing transactions. We defined commercial investors as 
entities that provide capital at market rates. This would include commercial lenders, DFIs, Private Equity, Venture Capital, 
and financial institutions, such as a bank that provides debt-based funding (such as lines of credit, unsecured loans or 
term loans) to businesses.

this capacity gap.
Pooling different capital sources, such as blending finance from public and private sectors, has great potential 
in funding enterprises in higher-risk sectors such as agriculture.  However, there are frequent disconnects on 
funding cycles, development objectives, and tied aid. For both climate mitigation and adaptation projects, the timelines 
of investors with different risk appetites may be inconsistent. This can reduce the effectiveness of financial collaboration. 
Today’s climate challenge demands new financial instruments and structures to align capital sources and accelerate 
disbursement. 
There are limitations to deploying climate capital in areas that most urgently need assistance with climate 
mitigation and adaptation actions in low- and middle-income countries such as Kenya. Where local financial 
institutions invest in climate mitigation projects, project risk may not align with available capital, and projects can be

countries, given the deep interdependencies between economic development priorities. Climate finance relies on such 
agencies for capital deployment and implementation of such activities, but the current structures, not designed to handle 
climate change, could hinder the flow of capital to urgently needed projects.
There can be a lack of alignment between committed capital, risk ratios, existing financial products, and the 
risk profiles of both climate adaptation and mitigation projects. When it comes to aligning sources and uses of 
funding, there is no variable more influential than risk, whether real or perceived. Project developers, businesses, and

on counterpart funding from the national and county governments and the revision of financial policies, e.g., reducing 
interest rates to increase financial accessibility in the CSA space.
It will be important to address the barriers preventing private capital from flowing into Kenya´s economy 
to unlock the agriculture sector’s large economic potential and to allow the successful implementation of 
the CSAIP proposed projects. The agriculture sector is one of the least funded sectors of the economy, with gross 
loans to the sector accounting for only 3.6 percent of total lending in 2021. From 2017 to 2021, there were signs of 
increased risk challenges and the need for improved risk-mitigation strategies within bank portfolios as non-performing 
loans grew by 43 percent. These developments call for increased risk insurance and guarantees to reduce operational 
risk. Despite operational risks, there has been an increase in investor appetite for innovative business models within the

concessional capital increased by 20 percent over the past four years, with guarantee and technical assistance remaining 
range bound at between 19-32 percent and 28-20 percent, respectively.
Funds remain the investment vehicle of choice, followed closely by direct investments into companies, which 
showed a 17 percent growth between 2020 and 2022 in Kenya. This is on the back of increased transaction numbers 
in agriculture from 12 to 17 deals between 2020 and 2022. Given the increased real and perceived risk in the sector, de-
risking will continue to play an active role in a bid to increase private sector participation.

‘process fatigues’ at both entrepreneur and investor ends. The problem is worsened when many enterprises in Kenya 
lack the documentation for due diligence, meaning investors have to rely on physical field visits to evaluate the company’s 
health.129 For investees, applying for finance from DFIs and international climate funds can be extremely time- and resource-
intensive, meaning some projects choose to forgo this capital in favor of other sources. Such slowdowns challenge capital 
disbursement by the investor and capital raising frustrates the investee.
There is a mismatch between the available pipeline and investor requirements. Suitable investment targets 
can be difficult to find from an investor’s perspective. Most investors have a tight investment focus in terms of sector, 
enterprise stage, and ticket size, thus making finding attractive deals challenging. From the perspective of the enterprises,

● Agriculture as a sector has been recognized by the 
National Government as a key economic driver of 
Kenya’s economy. Furthermore, the agriculture

As such the government has put in place several 
measures that are intended to spur the sector across

• High opportunity cost of capital that lowers the risk appetite of financial institutions 
• Limited supply of bankable businesses, as most investees in FCDC counties are early-stage companies or 
informal businesses, which do not meet the demands for established capital providers in terms of 
governance or stable cash flows 
• Communal land ownership that hinders use of land as collateral, as investees do not own assets with titles 
that can be used as collateral for credit access 
• Relatively prohibitive cost of capital 
• Limited options for long-term finance 
To address these issues, select donors are investors utilizing blended finance, grants, or technical assistance to

technologies often lack the demonstration or track record required to de-risk investment and are therefore considered 
too high risk by investors. Financial institutions lack the capacity to estimate climate-smart investment risks, meaning risk 
may be overestimated. In addition, lending terms and conditions often do not match the investees’ requirements, such as 
the loan duration. Also, risk-related financial instruments such as insurance have limited uptake within the Kenyan market 
and limited product development. Investees also lack an understanding of such instruments and their importance. The 
limited derisking applied to the investments hinders capital raising.

An analysis of investments in the agricultural industry indicates that the occurrence of funding boosts for 
companies and corporations in Kenya has surged in recent years, climbing from 12 percent in 2018 to 17 
percent in 2020. This increase, which can be attributed to an uptick in blended deals within the sector has been driven 
by the de-risking of capital, up from 16 percent in 2020 to 23 percent in 2021. The capital deployed by banks and SMEs
